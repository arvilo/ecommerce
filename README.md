# E-Commerce Project (CLI Simulation)

## Overview

This project is an **E-Commerce CLI simulation**, currently in its early stages of development. The goal is to build a Command Line Interface (CLI) version of an e-commerce platform. The project is being developed by **arvilo** and follows a structured approach to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Project Architecture

This project adopts the **Three-Tier Architecture**, which separates the system into three distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for user interaction via the CLI.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Handles the core functionality of the e-commerce system.
3. **Data Access Layer**: Manages the data interactions, using a file-based database for simplicity and rapid development.

## Database

For this project, a **file-based database** will be used to store and retrieve data, providing a lightweight solution during the initial development phase.

## Features

- **CLI Simulation**: Provides a command-line interface for user interaction.
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: Organizes the application into three distinct layers to separate concerns.
- **File-Based Database**: Data will be stored in files to allow for quick setup and iteration without requiring a complex database system.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the **development phase** and is continuously evolving. It is a **work in progress**, and new features will be added as development progresses.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine:
